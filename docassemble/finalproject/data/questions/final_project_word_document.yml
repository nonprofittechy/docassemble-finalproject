  These are some of the optional settings you can use to customize a Docassemble
  interview

  Some of the metadata fields are used for special purposes. You can add
  a new one if you like. You can access in your interview via
  all_variables(special='metadata'), which returns a dictionary.
metadata:

    - Jane Roe

  # Logo is made up of HTML code (no variables). You can put any HTML you like here.
  # The image itself needs to be part of an _installed package_ on the server
  # Or a static image on a site like imgur.com
