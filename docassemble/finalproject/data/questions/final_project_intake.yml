  These are some of the optional settings you can use to customize a Docassemble
  interview

  Some of the metadata fields are used for special purposes. You can add
  a new one if you like. You can access in your interview via
  all_variables(special='metadata'), which returns a dictionary.
metadata:
  title: |
    My Final Project
  short title: |
    Project
  authors: 
    - Jane Roe
    - John Doe
    - Quinten Steenhuis
  # Logo is made up of HTML code (no variables). You can put any HTML you like here.
  # The image itself needs to be part of an _installed package_ on the server
  # Or a static image on a site like imgur.com
  logo: |
    <img src="/packagestatic/docassemble.finalproject/suffolk-logo-boston.svg" style="max-height:1.9em;"/> <h3>My project</h3>

  You need to initialize your objects before using them

  - .simplify
  - .gsheets

  This code block controls the question order. Adding an ID is a good idea, but
  not required.
id: interview order
mandatory: True
code: |
  intro
  client.name.first
  client.address.address
  likes_fruit
  random_fact
  # This needs to be the second to last thing to run. Otherwise some variables might be undefined

code: |
  # get_simple_vars is a function that takes the whole Docassemble interview
  # And converts all the variables into a format that makes sense to save in 
  # a spreadsheet - i.e., only 2 dimensions.
  # It understands about Individual, Person, Address, and checkboxes, as well as
  # dates which will be converted to Year-Month-Date (2020-03-14) format.

  # append_with_column_labels takes the name of a Google Sheet and a dictionary
  # of key=>value pairs. It will add the values in the appropriate column,
  # based on headings in the first row. It will add new headings if needed.
  # You may have some variables you don't want to save in the spreadsheet. Add those
  # to the list given in skip= parameter.
  # I'm skipping the event/intro screens here.
  
  # It works with a Google Service Account, a special email address that you can
  # share a Google Sheet with to give it access.
  # The address is: google-sheets@lemma-legal-docassemble.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  # When sharing the sheet, uncheck the box "notify recipients"
